# Pongsakorn Onnim - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, My name is Pongsakorn Onnim. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering (Environmental Engineering). Currently, I'm looking for a data analyst job. I have skills in data analyst tools such as Python, R, SQL, Spreadsheet, and Tableau. I completed Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and Python for Everybody from Coursera and did hands-on projects from these courses.

Here is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data analytics topics.
